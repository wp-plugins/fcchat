/*
 * LANGUAGE TEMPLATE
 *
 * FCChat supports any language which uses the Latin alphabet. It does not have full support
 * for other alphabets at this time. 
 * 
 * To use this template, edit FCChat/config/config.js as follows:
 * 
 *  //language
 *    language_template:"english.js",
 *    
 * READ THIS BEFORE EDITING THIS TEMPLATE:
 * 
 * In some instances,  space is limited, so be brief with your descriptions and/or use 
 * abbreviations (button text, for example). Some text options have a width parameter 
 * associated with them, which specifies the width, in pixels, of the corresponding 
 * text element. This is used to establish the correct spacing between elements.
 * 
 * In this file comments are preceded by double slashes ie.
 *      //THIS IS A COMMENT
 *      
 * Only edit text that appears between double quotes, ie.
 * 
 *      t1: "MAKE YOUR CHANGES HERE",
 *      
 * DO not change any other elements of this file.
 * 
 * Please note: administrative functions are still in English only.
 * 
 * If you create a decent translation to a new language. Please email us the template at 
 * support@fastcatsoftware.com
